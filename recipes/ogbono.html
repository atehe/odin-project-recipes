<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Ogbono soup is a delectable Nigerian concoction soup and it’s super easy to
  prepare. It’s a thick and hearty stew made with Ogbono seeds (wild mango
  seeds) loaded with meats and fish simmered in a light delicious broth.
</p>
<p>
  When Ogbono is cooked it has a mucilaginous (slimy) texture like cooked Okra
  and Jute leaves (Ewedu). This is a stew and not a soup in the real sense but
  we call it soup anyways!
